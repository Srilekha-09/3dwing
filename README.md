# 3dwing



We are designing an ornithopter using matlab in that we designed wing.This code defines the geometry of a wing using the chord length, wing span, and a sinusoidal function to create a wing shape. The 'surf' function is then used to plot the 3D wing model with labels for the wing span, chord length, and wing thickness. 

In the code I provided, num_points refers to the number of points used to create a grid of x and y coordinates. The meshgrid function is used to create a grid of points with num_points equally spaced points along the wing_span and chord_length dimensions.
The meshgrid function returns two 2D arrays x and y, where each element of x and y represents a point in the grid. The linspace function is used to create num_points equally spaced points along the wing_span and chord_length dimensions.
By using meshgrid with these linspace values, we create a 2D grid with num_points equally spaced points along both dimensions. These points are then used to generate the z values of the wing surface using the sin and cos functions in the definition of z.
Increasing the value of num_points will result in a more detailed wing model, but will also increase the computational time and memory required to generate and display the 3D plot.
